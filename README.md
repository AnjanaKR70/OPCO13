# SCAMഉണ്ടോ (Scamundo)

A preventive security app that scans documents and links **before you open them**, and warns you if they look like a scam.

Phishing links and malicious files spread mostly through chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, and people usually open them within seconds. SCAMഉണ്ടോ checks the content first, gives a clear verdict (Green / Yellow / Red) with a simple explanation, and raises an SOS-style alert for dangerous content.

> **Status:** Work in progress. This README describes what the project is going to include.

## Features

### Document scanning
- Scans **PDF, DOCX/DOCM, PPTX and XLSX/XLSM** files
- Extracts structural and security features (metadata, embedded objects, macros, URLs, strings, entropy)
- ML model classifies each file as benign or malicious

### URL scanning
- Checks links for phishing and malicious behaviour
- URL structure features: length, dots, hyphens, digits, subdomains, IP address instead of domain, HTTPS
- Suspicious keywords (`login`, `verify`, `kyc`, `refund`, bank and brand names) and suspicious TLDs
- Lookalike domain detection (e.g. `amaz0n`, `paytm-secure`)
- Domain age and SSL certificate checks
- Short link expansion, so the final destination is what gets checked
- Blocklist and whitelist checks (Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank, OpenPhish, URLhaus)


### Risk verdict
- Confidence score for every scan
- **Green** (safe), **Orange** (suspicious), **Red** (malicious)
- Plain-language reasons, e.g. "Domain registered 3 days ago, imitates SBI"

### Alerts and reporting
- Full-screen warning with a recommended action
- SOS alert for high-risk content with beep sound
- Reporting of malicious content (planned integration with Cyberdome, 1930 and cybercrime.gov.in)

### Automatic interception (Android)
- Detects incoming documents and links before they are opened and scans them automatically
